## Summary

[summary]: #summary

CEP PR: [casperlabs/ceps#0060](https://github.com/casperlabs/ceps/pull/60)

The purpose of this feature is to increase the variety of tokens in the network, thereby creating new areas of use for casper.

## Motivation

[motivation]: #motivation


If something has to be used, it is more valuable because it is now a necessity.

Cryptocurrency is a really big industry and we need to be in other networks as the most modern network in this industry.
and if we add this features, we will have more than trading volume and using area.
if something is need to use, it is 

## Guide-level explanation

Casper X-Chain - Connect All Blockchain world.

-> All Assests whihc working on casper network connected blockhain world so
if you publish a smart contract on casper x-chain, Ä°t will be run in all blockchain.
for example you publish a altcoin on casper x-chain, your contract support will be olds blockchain.


## Reference-level explanation

Stepe 1-
Building Altchain maybe it using etherhum virtual chain
Step 2-
Writing Smart Contract on Rust & Soldity

                                      
Casper Network      <---->      Casper X-Chain     <----->       Etherhum & Binance Smartchain Ecosytem
                                  
if you write smart contract on x-chain, your token run Casper Network and BSC,Etherum network

Step 3-
X-Chain will be support connecting Metamask,WalletConnect and etc...

Step 4-
Planing Testnet and testing x-chain
Step 4-
X-Chain Upgrade to mainnet



## Drawbacks

[drawbacks]: #drawbacks

None at the moment.

## Rationale and alternatives

if X-Chain can't build it, we can solve this problem using by smart contract.

## Prior art

## Future possibilities

[future-possibilities]: #future-possibilities

This CEP is designed to increase the usage areas of casper network, There are many networks in the cryptocurrency world and the biggest problem is that these networks are independent from each other.
if we can connect all networks, We become a safe and fast ecosystem for all digital assets.
If etherhum is valuable, it's because it can connect to other networks. but Etherhum network is old, so it havemany problem for example high gas fee,slow network
!! Casper ecosystem could be the biggest ecosystem of the future because it's really good as a network.
